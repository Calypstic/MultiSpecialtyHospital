NOTE: The code is written in python along with SQL integration

The code solves the problem given in the pdf using data integration and pipeline life cycle along with TDD.
The phases in the code are marked using comments

1. Creation phase
2. Data capture
3. ETL
4. Segmentation phase
5. Data warehousing/storage

To be as accurate as possible to the real time environment, 
I have used sql database as an input to the code and the output is generated over both .csv files and sql database.
